How to play:
Watch a set of boxes appear briefly and memorize the total. When they vanish, tap to increase your guess or type the number, then press Done. Single-player: beat your time and accuracy. Multiplayer/local or vs bot: play 5–10 rounds — highest accuracy wins. Simple taps, short rounds, perfect for training memory, attention and reaction on desktop & mobile.
